AIShortCut Admin Dashboard

AIShortCut Admin Dashboard is a robust, feature-packed web app that serves as the control center for the AIShortCut mobile app. Designed from scratch with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and modern UI/UX, this dashboard lets you seamlessly manage app content, users, and analytics—all in real time.

📰 Core Features

Article Management:
Effortlessly create, edit, and publish news articles via an advanced rich text editor. All articles go directly from the dashboard to users—delivering fresh, well-formatted content straight to the mobile app!

User Administration:
View, search, and manage all users. Instantly check user engagement, handle key actions, and keep the community safe and active.

Analytics at a Glance:
Instantly visualize vital stats: downloads, article reads, app engagement, popular content, and more.

Instant Publishing:
The dashboard is directly connected to Firebase—so any newly published or edited article automatically appears on every device running the mobile app.

Mobile App Integration:
Manage everything from the dashboard. All changes, analytics, and user actions sync instantly to the AIShortCut mobile app [see it on GitHub](https://github.com/yogshkr/AIShortCut).

⚙️ How It Works

This dashboard acts as the backend brain for the AIShortCut ecosystem:

Firebase is the real-time data layer between the dashboard and the mobile app, allowing instant, secure, and scalable communication.

Rich text editor empowers content creators (like you!) to deliver detailed, interactive news with images, links, and custom formatting.

Powerful user management lets admins monitor growth, usage patterns, and engagement—fueling data-driven decisions.
